# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Project Overview
This is a modern implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game, built with **React**. The game features a sleek and responsive UI, interactive gameplay with icons for choices, and a live scoreboard to track wins, losses, and ties. This project is designed to demonstrate my front-end development skills and React fundamentals.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For game logic and interactivity.

## What I Learned
- **React Fundamentals**: State management with `useState`, component-based architecture, and props.
- **Responsive Design**: Building a mobile-friendly and desktop-friendly layout.
- **UI/UX Design**: Adding animations, hover effects, and a clean, modern look.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Using conditional logic to handle gameplay scenarios.

## Demo Video
Here’s a demo of the game in action:
